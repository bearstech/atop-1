atop (2.2.6-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  atop does some really weird things with logrotate, which cause
  undocumented behavior in logrotate versions < 3.11. As Debian stretch
  has 3.11, this should not be an issue when updating between stable
  versions.
  
  If you have been using unstable or testing, and you get weird
  messages from logrotate, it might be worth looking in /var/log/atop
  for weird log files, and removing all dummy_* files other than
  dummy_after and dummy_before.

atop (2.2.6-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  PID file /run/atopacctd.pid not readable (yet?) after start
  
  This is an issue when upgrading from one of the experimental atop
  versions that have never been in Debian unstable. I therefore don't
  consider it a bug. The issue is already reported (#842136, #849138).
  Please don't file additional bug reports for this issue.
  
  Here is an explanation from upstream (quoting Gerlof with his kind
  permission):
  
  |(…), I think that this caused by the fact that the previous run of
  |atopacctd did not terminate properly. That causes the fact that
  |files and directories are not removed by atopacctd, giving problems
  |with the next activation.

  |Obviously, it is possble to remove these files and directories
  |*during* the next activation (instead of terminating with an error
  |message). However, I don't want to do that since the existence of
  |the /run/pacct_shadow.d directory might also indicate that the
  |atopacctd daemon is already running (then a second incarnation
  |should refuse to start).

  |So when the issue is solved that atopacctd refuses to terminate (…),
  |the issue of the existing /run/pacct_shadow.d directory should also
  |be irrelevant IMHO.
  
  When atopacctd receives signal 2, 3 or 15, it finishes and destroys
  the files/directories it has created. If you encounter the situation
  that atopacctd does not start because it complains about pidfile
  and/or /run/pacct_* directories/files, please send SIGTERM to any
  atopacctd process that may still hang around, and if the
  files/directories are still there without the corresponding atopacctd
  process, please remove them manually and then try starting atopacctd
  again.

  KERNEL ISSUES WITH PROCESS ACCOUNTING

  Newer upstream kernels have two issues with process accounting.
  These were isolated and debugged in #833997

  1) Sometimes process accounting does not work at all¹. Atopacctd tries to
  work around this issue, by retrying to initialize process accounting
  several times.

  2) When using the NETLINK interface, the command TASKSTATS_CMD_GET
  consequently returns -EINVAL². Atopacctd needs NETLINK to be able to
  be triggered that some process in the system has finished. In this way
  atopacctd can be in a blocking state as long as no processes terminate.
  When atopacctd detects this condition it thus switches into a polling
  state to periodically try if it can read process accounting records as
  a workaround. This issue has to do with cpumask and you can work-around
  it by building a kernel that has CONFIG_NR_CPUS configured to exactly
  the amount of CPUs (logical CPUs) in the system the kernel runs on. You
  can find this kernel option under "Processor type and features" -->
  "Maximum number of CPUs".

  There are also Debian bug reports for those two issues, #848682 and
  #848683

atop (2.2.3-1~exp1) experimental; urgency=low

  * atop's log file format in /var/log has changed. Old log files will
    be moved away on upgrade so that the new atop will actually start.
  * currently the restart of atop does not work because in some
    circumstances, atop won't read its own log file. Symptom is that
    atop doesn't run after restart and /var/log/atop/daily.log says
    incompatible log format. Upstream has been informed of that. I am
    uploading to experimental to get preliminary comments from users.
